//Hello word//

In this book we have run our first code.

//printexamples//

we will see some examples of numbers, integers, strings and words.
so whenever we will run string we have to run it in double quotes (") but we can run integers without double quotes.

//string//

In string, we will see that how we can use double and single quotes in string.
variables in string and how to use input function.

//escape characters//

In this book we will learn that how we can cut a string in two parts, and we can create tabs in string.
we can run string in a way so that we will get the result in two different lines.
how with the help of slashes (/) we can make or break a string.

//Operators//

In this book we will learn that how we can solve operators, and the use of (for) loop with operators. 

//string2//

In file string 2 we will see indexing in sting.
in order to go indexing in string we need to use square bracket on the place of the character which we want to come as result.
